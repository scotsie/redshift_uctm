title: Redshift UCTM: Disk Space (Individual Filesystems)
agents: special

description:
 This check monitors individual filesystem disk space usage on Redshift
 Networks UCTM devices.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Redshift Networks UCTM}.

 The check reports disk space for each mounted filesystem including total
 space, used space, available space, and percentage utilization using
 standard filesystem metrics (fs_used, fs_size, fs_free, fs_used_percent).

 Thresholds can be configured via the ruleset "Redshift UCTM Disk Space".
 Default thresholds are {WARN} at 80% and {CRIT} at 90%.

 This check complements the "Redshift UCTM: HDD Total Usage" check which
 monitors overall disk usage, while this check provides per-filesystem
 granularity.

discovery:
 One service is created for each filesystem reported by the device.

item:
 The filesystem device path or mount point (e.g., "/dev/disk1", "/dev/cf1")
