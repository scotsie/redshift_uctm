title: Redshift UCTM: Processor Statistics (Aggregate)
agents: special
catalog: os/kernel

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors aggregate CPU statistics across all processors on
 Redshift Networks UCTM devices.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Redshift Networks UCTM}.

 The check reports CPU utilization broken down by user, system, I/O wait,
 and idle time. It calculates total CPU utilization (100% - idle) and
 provides detailed metrics for all CPU time categories.

 Discovery parameters control whether to discover aggregate statistics,
 individual CPU cores, or both.

 Thresholds can be configured via the ruleset "Redshift UCTM Processor".
 Default thresholds are {WARN} at 80% total utilization and {CRIT} at 90%.

 I/O wait can also be monitored with separate thresholds (default {WARN}
 at 30%, {CRIT} at 50%).

discovery:
 One service for aggregate CPU statistics is created by default if processor
 data is available. Individual CPU core services can be discovered by
 enabling the "individual" discovery parameter.

item:
 None for aggregate statistics. CPU core number (e.g., "0", "1", "2") for
 individual core statistics.
