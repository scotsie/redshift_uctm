description:
 This check monitors detailed memory statistics from Redshift Networks
 UCTM devices including main memory, swap space, and total available memory.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Redshift Networks UCTM}.

 The check reports memory usage with metrics for used and free memory
 in main memory, swap space, and total combined memory.

 Discovery parameters allow discovering aggregate memory statistics,
 individual memory types (Mem, Swap), or both.

 Thresholds can be configured via the ruleset "Redshift UCTM Memory".
 Default thresholds are {WARN} at 80% utilization and {CRIT} at 90%.

discovery:
 One service for aggregate memory statistics is created by default if
 memory data is available. Individual services for each memory type
 can be discovered by enabling the "individual" discovery parameter.

item:
 None for aggregate statistics. Memory type ("Mem:", "Swap:", "Total:")
 for individual memory type statistics.
